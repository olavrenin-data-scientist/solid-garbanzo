    "Data manipulation is a fundamental step in the data analysis process and involves reshaping, transforming, or otherwise preparing your data for further exploration, analysis, or visualization. When working with pandas dataframes, common data manipulation tasks include subsetting (selecting specific portions of the data), sorting (arranging data in a certain order), and creating new columns (often from existing ones). These operations not only allow for a streamlined analysis process by focusing on relevant data, but also enable the creation of new insights and patterns from the dataset, thus making data manipulation an essential skill in the data scientist's toolbox.\n",

    "You also might want to create new categorical variables. For example, your stakeholders are mostly interested in what we might call high energy music. Therefore, we might want to transform the continuous variable `energy` to a categorical variable `energy level` which classifies the song as high (energy level of 68-100), medium (energy level of 34-67), or low (energy level of 0-33). We’ll use the `cut()` method like this:\n",
