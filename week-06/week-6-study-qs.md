To test for understanding of these key points on execution time and Big O Notation, you could ask the following questions:

1. **Importance of Execution Time:**
   - Why is it important to consider execution time when working with large datasets?
   - Can you provide an example of when an inefficient algorithm might become impractical?

2. **Manual Measurement with `time.time()`:**
   - What are the limitations of using `time.time()` to measure execution time, especially for comparing algorithms?
   - When might manually measuring execution time be helpful, and when might it fall short?

3. **Growth Rate Matters More:**
   - Why is the growth rate of an algorithm's execution time more important than a single execution time measurement?
   - How can understanding growth rate help you make better decisions when selecting an algorithm for large datasets?

4. **Big O Notation:**
   - What is Big O notation, and how does it help in understanding algorithm efficiency?
   - Can you describe a situation where Big O notation might guide your choice between two algorithms?

5. **Example of Exponential Growth:**
   - What happens to the execution time of an algorithm when it exhibits exponential growth as the input size increases?
   - Why would an algorithm with exponential growth be impractical for large datasets?

These questions focus on both conceptual understanding and practical application.
