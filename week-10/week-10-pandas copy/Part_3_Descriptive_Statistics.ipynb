    "From this data, herbivores appear to have the longest lifespans. However, it's crucial to treat these findings as descriptive of the specific dataset we're using, rather than making broad generalizations. Various factors can influence these results that aren't necessarily connected to diet. For instance, the long lifespan of elephants (a well-known trait of this species) contributes significantly to the average lifespan of the herbivore group.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we use `groupby()` to answer our question: \"What are the characteristics of the most popular songs?\" We need to use `popularity` as a grouping column and then calculate descriptive statistics to describe the characteristics of popular songs. We usually use categorical variables for grouping columns, like `diet` in the example above. `Popularity` is a continuous variable. To use it as a grouping variable, we can create a categorical variable `popularity_range` using the familiar `cut()` method to create ranges (or \"bins\") of `popularity`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we use`cut()` to create five bins of popularity: 'Very Low' (0-20), 'Low' (20-40), 'Medium' (40-60), 'High' (60-80), and 'Very High' (80-100). We add this new column 'popularity_range' to our music DataFrame:"
